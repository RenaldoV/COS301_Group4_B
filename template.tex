\section{Testability}
Nice-to-have\\
Testability cannot be fully implemented or given a high priority because quality requirements, scalability and auditability have been given high priority and that affects the extent to which the system can be tested. Users will test the system and give their feedback.\\
\section{Usability}
Important\\ 
The system must be as usable as possible so that users are encouraged to use it as much as possibile. The extent to which the system can be made usable is affected by the priority of scalability and auditability because if the system is made scalable so that it can be used by all students at the same time, it is imposible to cater for 2000 student's needs and make it 100\% usable for the mass. Usability is marked important because the participation of students can be greatly affected if the system is unuseable and students will then lose marks.\\
\section{Integrability}
Important\\
One of the main functional requirements of the buzz system is pluggability, this goes hand in hand with the quality reuirement integrability thus marked as important. The system need to be able to plug into any other systems and als need to use other systems where it can.\\
