\section{Architectural Responsibilities}
\subsection{Persistence Infrastructure}


\begin{itemize}
\item As per the client requirements, some of the textual data generated or used in the buzz system will be maintained through persistent storage like a relational database. All media files and documents will then be stored on a separate directory on the server.
\item The buzz system will also make use of LDAP (CS databases). So the CS databases have to share resources (cross-origin resource sharing) with the buzz system.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Reporting Infrastructure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Send daily email notification to contributors of a thread
\item Send instant email notifications to 
	\begin{itemize} 
	\item Owner of a thread or post when a thread/post is \\
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Updated 
			\item Deleted 
			\item Received a reply
			\item Referenced 	
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
