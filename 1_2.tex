\subsection{Quality requirements}
	\subsubsection{Critical}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Scalability: \\
			The system is expected to have at least a 1000 users and can be expanded as specified by the client. Buzz Space is meant to encourage discussions on multiple topics at the same time by a large amount of users so the system needs to be able to handle many concurrent users too.
			\item Maintenance and Audit-ability \\
			The system should be monitor-able and audit-able, to enable lecturers to monitor the discussion boards and to see who posted what on the Buzz Space. Lecturers should be able to evaluate and monitor each user to be able to give the user a participation mark for the discussion board. Lecturers should be able to prevent irrelevant posts and discussions and should be able to see who were part of the discussion and notify them that it has been removed and should then be able to give them a warning.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Important}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Usability \\
			The system must be as usable as possible so that users are encouraged to use it as much as possible. The extent to which the system can be made usable is affected by the priority of scalability and audit-ability because if the system is made scalable so that it can be used by all students at the same time, it is impossible to cater for 2000 students' needs and make it 100\% usable for the mass. Usability is marked important because the participation of students can be greatly affected if the system is unusable and students will then lose marks.

			\item Integrability\\
			One of the functional requirements is that the system be integrate-able into other systems as a discussion board. The MVC pattern can be used to achieve this. The system will be split up from the view and the data so the data can be changed easily to suit the systems that is integrating this system into it.
			
			\item Security
