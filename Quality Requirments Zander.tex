\section{Quality Requirements}
\subsection{Scalability - Critical}
The system is expected to have a maximum of 2000 users as specified by the client. Buzz Space is meant to encourage discussions on muliple topics at the same time by a large amount of users so the system needs to be able to handle many concurrent users too.

\subsection{Performance - Nice to have}
Performance is expected to be reduced as scalability takes priority. When the system is being used by a large amount of people at one time it will be acceptable for it to take a few seconds to do anything. For small amounts of concurrent users the system should still be fast.

\subsection{Maintainabilty - Nice to have}
Once the system is implamented it is not expected to need regular maintenance as reliability is an important quality requirement.
