\subsection{Integration and access channel requirements}
	\subsubsection{Integration requirements}
		The Buzz System should integrate seamlessly with the following existing systems:		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item LDAP as an user authentication service
			\item CSWEB as a route to the Buzz System and as a summary of certain Buzz Spaces
			\item CS Department mailing server
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Creating threads/replying to threads by email 
					\item Notifying users on changes/updates/replies to threads/spaces
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Access Channels}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Human Access
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Thin Client\\
					A client will access the system using a modern browser that supports HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript 
						\begin{itemize}
							\item All necessary resources need to be downloaded from the server.
							\item Will use a RESTful API 
							\item User Interface can be scaled according to device/size of the window to ensure readability and usability. E.g. Bootstrap.
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item System Access\\
			Other systems will access the system via the API provided as this system will act as a plugin that can be used on any other system that wishes to add a discussion board. RESTful will be the main approach to the API.
		\end{itemize}
